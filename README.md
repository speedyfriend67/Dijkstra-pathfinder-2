# Dijkstra Pathfinding Visualization with Multiple End Points

This project enhances the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm visualization in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, introducing multiple end points for added complexity. Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the grid cells to create obstacles or walls.
3. The green circle represents the start point, and the red circles with numbers represent multiple end points.
4. The algorithm will calculate the shortest path from the start to each end point, navigating around obstacles.
5. Observe the visualization of the algorithm's progress and the final paths to each end point.

## Customizable Colors

You can customize the colors used in the visualization:

- `backgroundColor`: Background color of the grid cells.
- `wallColor`: Color of the walls or obstacles.
- `startColor`: Color of the start point.
- `endColor`: Color of the end points.
- `pathColor`: Color of the paths found by the algorithm.

Modify these color variables in the JavaScript code to suit your preferences.

## Features

- Interactive grid for drawing obstacles.
- Real-time visualization of Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to multiple end points.
- Start point and numbered end points for defining the paths.

## Customization

Feel free to customize and enhance the project:

- Adjust the grid size and canvas dimensions.
- Experiment with different heuristics for pathfinding.
- Add additional features, such as diagonal movement or weighted edges.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
